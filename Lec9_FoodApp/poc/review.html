                Generalization –
                Generalization is the process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and create a
                generalized entity from it. It is a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities can be generalized
                to a higher level entity if they have some attributes in common. For Example, STUDENT and FACULTY can be
                generalized to a higher level entity called PERSON as shown in Figure 1. In this case, common attributes
